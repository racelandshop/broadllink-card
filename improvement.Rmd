## Possible improvements:

### Frontend side:
 - Implement a visual effect when the broadlinks are being searched
 - In editor generate the preset programatically with a loop or a .map
 - I would like to avoid to have to record the avaiable remotes in each card configuration. Maybe save in the frontend object
 - Implement a "permanent" and a "quick" learning mode using a long vs a short press
 - Implement longpress, so each remote has x2 the number of options
 - Add a default option to the input_select in the editor
 - stylize the Discoverbroalink ha-card

### Backend side:

 - Allow the devices in backend to be registered as proper entities (just for remote or for a selection of devices)
 - Improve presets (allow the creation of new presets with custom names)
 - Save avaialble device data in the frontend object and not in the card configuration
 - Implement other button types (and tie them to the presest)
