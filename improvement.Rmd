## Possible improvements:

 - Allow the devices in backend to be registered as proper entities (just for remote or for a selection of devices)
 - Improve presets (allow the creation of new presets with custom names)
 - Save avaialble device data in the frontend object and not in the card configuration
 - Implement other button types (and tie them to the presest)
