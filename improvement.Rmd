## Possible improvements:

### Frontend side:
 - I would like to avoid to have to record the avaiable remotes in each card configuration. Maybe save in the frontend object
 - Improve shouldUpdate in editor


### Backend side:
 - Allow the devices in backend to be registered as proper entities (just for remote or for a selection of devices) > not sure if homeassistant suports this
 - How to handle a locked broadlink?
 - Test suite? check broadlink integration
